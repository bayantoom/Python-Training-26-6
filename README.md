# Python Training Day 3

This README file provide a brief summary of what I have learned in this module.


### Classes: 

- **A template for creating objects.**
- **Define attributes and methods.**
- **To create a class, use the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon.** 
- **The class body contains the class attributes and methods.**


>> Note: Method = Function, Attribute = Variable 

### Objects: 

- **Object is an instance of a class.**
- **To create an object, call the class name followed by parentheses.**

### Attributes: 

- **Attributes are variables that store data for an object.**
- **To create an attribute, define a variable inside the class body.**

### Methods: 

- **Methods are functions that perform actions related to the object.**
- **To create a method, define a function inside the class body.**
- **The first parameter of the method should be "self".**

### Inheritance: 

- **Allows you to create a new class (subclass or child class) that inherits properties and methods from an existing class (superclass or parent class).**
